# inventory_website
This website facilitates the management of mouldings and matboards inventory for a picture framing business. It uses price list files from Larson-Juhl and TC Moulding that were acquired in 2018. Inventory is stored and manipulated with mariadb.

TODO: refactor code to fit the directory structure as outlined by [simple-php-website](https://github.com/banago/simple-php-website/blob/master/index.php) and research how to incoporate sql files with this.
